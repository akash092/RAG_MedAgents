OBJECTIVES: Numerous interventions have been implemented to enhance adherence to 
antihypertensive medications, yet only a few have utilized health behavioral 
theories. The research quality and efficacy of these theory-based studies remain 
undetermined. This systematic review aimed to provide a thorough description of 
research that employed health behavior theories to improve medication adherence 
in patients diagnosed with hypertension, particularly in primary healthcare and 
community settings.
METHODS: PubMed and Scopus were searched for randomized clinical trials that 
employed health behavioral theories to improve medication adherence in patients 
with hypertension, published in English between 2013 and 2023. Data were 
extracted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and 
Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The Joanna Briggs Institute critical 
appraisal tool was used to evaluate the risk of bias.
RESULTS: Of the 446 studies initially identified, only 10 met the inclusion 
criteria and were included in this systematic review. Eight studies employed a 
single theory, and 2 applied a combination of theories, with Social Cognitive 
Theory and the Transtheoretical Model being the most predominant. Six trials 
demonstrated a notable enhancement in medication adherence, while 5 studies were 
assessed to have a high risk of bias.
CONCLUSIONS: Although not all studies employed a complete theoretical framework, 
the majority indicate that utilizing theory can enhance medication adherence.
