Pregnancy is an exciting time, with great anticipation of the future for the 
woman and her baby. However, for women with mechanical heart valves (MHVs) 
pregnancy is a challenging undertaking fraught with risk to them and their baby. 
This article considers the issues for the woman, highlighting pre-surgical 
opportunities, pre-pregnancy counselling, the issues to consider with fertility 
treatment, the options during pregnancy for anti-coagulation management and the 
recognition and management of complications. This update stresses the complex 
challenges in the management of women with MHV during pregnancy and the need for 
specialist multi-disciplinary team involvement.
