Risk factors for West Nile neuroinvasive disease and mortality in the United 
States, 2013-2024.

Judson SD, Dowdy D.

IMPORTANCE: West Nile virus (WNV) is the leading mosquito-borne infection in the 
United States and can cause West Nile fever (WNF) or West Nile neuroinvasive 
disease (WNND), resulting in substantial morbidity and mortality. Contemporary 
risk factor analyses are needed to identify populations at increased risk for 
severe outcomes and target interventions accordingly.
OBJECTIVE: To assess risk factors for WNND and mortality among adults with WNV 
infection using a large national cohort from federated real-world data.
DESIGN: A retrospective cohort analysis from 2013-2024, consisting of 
de-identified electronic health record data from the TriNetX Research Network, 
including adult patients with an ICD-10 diagnosis consistent with WNV infection. 
Data were accessed from March 28 th to April 30 th , 2025.
SETTING: The retrospective cohort included patients from 65 healthcare 
organizations from across the United States, using the TriNetX Research Network.
PARTICIPANTS: The overall initial cohort included 3,064 adult patients with an 
ICD-10 diagnosis consistent with WNV infection, including 1,328 with WNF and 
1,206 with WNND.
EXPOSURES: Demographic characteristics (age, sex, race, ethnicity), 
comorbidities (hematologic malignancy, ischemic heart disease, other forms of 
heart disease, diabetes, HIV, chronic kidney disease (CKD), liver disease, 
hypertension, alcohol related disorders, cerebrovascular disease (CEVD), chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, multiple sclerosis, dementia, rheumatoid 
arthritis, organ transplant), and medications (immune suppressants, 
antineoplastics).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcomes were the development of WNND 
and all-cause mortality (30-day, 90-day, and overall mortality).
RESULTS: Among all patients diagnosed with WNV infection, those with WNND were 
older (mean age 59 vs 55, p-value <0.0001) and more often male (61% vs 48%, 
p-value <0.0001). Significant risk factors for WNND included age (adjusted 
hazard ratio [aHR] 1.11 per decade, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.06-1.49), 
male sex (aHR 1.29, 1.15-1.45), CKD (aHR 1.21, 1.002-1.45), CEVD (aHR 1.22, 
1.03-1.45), hematologic malignancy (aHR 1.38, 1.09-1.76), immune suppressant use 
(aHR 1.43, 1.11-1.83), hypertension (aHR 1.18, 1.04-1.34), alcohol related 
disorders (aHR 1.54, 1.20-1.97), and multiple sclerosis (aHR 2.3, 1.62-3.37). 
Significant risk factors for mortality were WNND (aHR 2.49 for 30-day mortality, 
95% CI 1.37-4.52), age (aHR 1.32 per decade, 95% CI 1.07-1.60), CKD (aHR 2.08, 
95% CI 1.01-3.93), and CEVD (aHR 2.00, 95% CI 1.14-3.50).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Risk factors for WNND broadly reflect impaired immune 
response and/or central nervous system vulnerability. Patients who developed 
WNND were at substantially increased risk of death. Targeted prevention 
strategies and countermeasures for those at greatest risk for WNND could 
substantially reduce morbidity and mortality.
KEY POINTS: Question: What are risk factors for West Nile virus neuroinvasive 
disease and mortality in the United States between 2013 and 2024?Findings: In 
this retrospective cohort analysis, we found that increased age, chronic kidney 
disease, and cerebrovascular disease are significantly associated with both West 
Nile neuroinvasive disease and mortality. Additionally, male sex, hematologic 
malignancy, immune suppressants, hypertension, alcohol related disorders, and 
multiple sclerosis were significant risk factors for West Nile neuroinvasive 
disease.Meaning: An aging population in the United States with increasing rates 
of comorbidities and immunosuppression faces an increased risk for severe 
disease from West Nile virus infection.
