Metabolic syndrome, characterized by central obesity, hypertension, 
hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and reduced high-density lipoprotein levels, 
significantly increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases. Vitamin D, 
essential for calcium regulation and immune modulation, has been linked to 
reduced inflammation and metabolic syndrome. This study aimed to develop machine 
learning models to predict vitamin D deficiency using data from publicly funded 
health check-ups in Taiwan. A total of 6,046 adults aged 30 years and older were 
included, with data on demographics, anthropometric measures, and biochemical 
indicators. Six algorithms, including logistic regression, random forest, SVM, 
XGBoost, LightGBM, and MLP, were evaluated. Models were trained and tuned using 
stratified sampling and K-fold cross-validation. XGBoost demonstrated the best 
overall performance, with high accuracy, F1-Score, and balanced precision and 
recall, supporting its applicability for predicting vitamin D deficiency. Future 
research should address feature quality, class imbalance, and dataset diversity 
to enhance predictive frameworks for vitamin D deficiency.
