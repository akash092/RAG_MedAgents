BACKGROUND: The onset age of hypertension has decreased significantly due to 
lifestyle changes over the years. However, the link between hypertension onset 
age and subsequent incidence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) remains unclear.
METHODS: Individual-level data were obtained from the UK Biobank. Information on 
the diagnosis of hypertension and CKD was collected at baseline and follow-up. 
The propensity score matching method and Cox proportional hazards models were 
used to evaluate the relationship between different hypertension morbidity ages 
and the incidence of CKD.
RESULTS: A total of 485,101 participants without CKD at baseline were included 
in this analysis (women, 265,343 [54.70%]). Among the 186,880 participants with 
hypertension, the multivariable-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for developing CKD 
was 1.117 (95% CI: 1.102-1.132) for each 10-year decrease in age at the onset of 
hypertension. After applying propensity score matching, the risk of CKD in 
hypertensive patients was significantly higher compared to those without 
hypertension across all age groups. Additionally, the hazard ratios tended to 
increase with a decrease in age at the onset of hypertension. Subgroup analysis 
showed that participants with cardiovascular disease (CVD) at baseline increased 
the adverse effect of hypertension on CKD in younger participants.
CONCLUSIONS: Our research indicated that the younger the age at hypertension 
diagnosis, the greater the risk of developing CKD. Individuals who experience 
the onset of hypertension before the age of 45 may constitute a high-risk CKD 
subpopulation, highlighting the need for vigilant monitoring and early 
intervention.
