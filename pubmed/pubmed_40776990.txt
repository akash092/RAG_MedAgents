INTRODUCTION: hypertension in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a 
major problem that increases the risk of morbidity and mortality. Although the 
prevalence of this disease is high in the T2DM population, the risk factors for 
it remain understudied. The objective of this study is to identify the risk 
factors combined with hypertension in Moroccan patients with T2DM.
METHODS: this cross-sectional study was conducted between January 2017 and July 
2018 in primary healthcare centers. A total of 503 T2DM patients were included. 
Inclusion criteria: adults (≥18 years) with T2DM for ≥1 year. Exclusion 
criteria: type 1 diabetes, gestational diabetes, cognitive impairment, or 
missing data. Data on demographics, clinical history, and biochemical markers 
were analyzed using SPSS. Logistic regression identified independent risk 
factors, reported as adjusted OR with 95% CI. A p-value <0.05 was considered 
statistically significant.
RESULTS: a total of 503 patients with T2DM were included (71% female, 29% male), 
with a mean age of 58.4 ± 10.2 years. The prevalence of hypertension was 70.2%. 
Patients with hypertension were significantly older (mean age: 61.2 ± 9.8 years 
vs. 52.6 ± 10.5 years, p ≤ 0.001). The most common cardiovascular risk factors 
were dyslipidemia (54.1%), obesity (mean BMI: 30.8 ± 5.6 kg/m2), and a sedentary 
lifestyle (50.6%). Multivariable logistic regression identified older age (OR: 
4.74, 95% CI: 2.47-9.10; p ≤ 0.001), longer diabetes duration (OR: 2.28, 95% CI: 
1.14-4.53; p = 0.018), BMI levels (OR: 1.05, 95% CI: 1.00-1.10; p = 0.019), 
dyslipidemia (OR: 2.07, 95% CI: 1.28-3.33; p = 0.003), and therapeutic 
modifications (OR: 1.98, 95% CI: 1.11-3.53; p = 0.020) as significant risk 
factors.
CONCLUSION: in this study, we found that hypertension is highly prevalent among 
patients with T2DM. Our findings indicate that older age, longer diabetes 
duration, therapeutic modifications, dyslipidemia, and higher BMI levels are 
significant risk factors for diabetes.
