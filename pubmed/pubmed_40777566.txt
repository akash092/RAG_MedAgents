BACKGROUND: Malnutrition is increasingly recognized as a modifiable prognostic 
factor in myocardial infarction (MI), yet traditional nutritional assessment 
methods often fail to adequately capture lipid-related atherogenic risk. We 
introduced an innovative modified Controlling Nutritional Status (mCONUT) score, 
which replaces total cholesterol with non-HDL cholesterol, aiming to improve the 
stratification of atherosclerotic risk and to assess its prognostic utility in 
predicting MI outcomes.
METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we analyzed a total of 3,730 
patients diagnosed with MI, extracted from the MIMIC-IV database, and stratified 
them into Normal, Mild, and Worse groups based on the mCONUT score. After 
performing 1:1:1 propensity score matching, we selected 993 patients for 
comparative analysis. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models, adjusted 
for clinical and demographic confounders, were employed to evaluate all-cause 
mortality at 180 days and 1 year.
RESULTS: Among 993 MI patients, the median age was 75 years (IQR 68-82) with 
58.4% males (n = 580). Malnutrition severity (mCONUT ≥6) stratified prognostic 
risk: Worse group demonstrated progressive mortality increases (180-day: 13.9% 
vs. Normal 7.85%, p = 0.037; 1-year: 31.4% vs. 21.2%, p = 0.011), alongside 
lower BMI, extended hospitalization, reduced hypertension, higher CKD incidence, 
and diminished revascularization (all p < 0.05). Multivariable analyses 
confirmed graded mortality risk: 180-day (Model 1: adjusted HR 1.58, p = 0.009; 
Model 2: HR 1.46, p = 0.031) and 1-year (Model 1: HR 1.61, p = 0.002; Model 2: 
HR 1.52, p = 0.008). Consistency across subgroups was observed, with heightened 
vulnerability in males, hypertensives (interaction p = 0.004), diabetes and 
non-white individuals.
CONCLUSIONS: The mCONUT score has emerged as a robust multidimensional biomarker 
for predicting MI prognosis, with worse malnutrition (mCONUT ≥ 6) being 
significantly associated with a 46%-61% elevation in mortality risk, 
demonstrating a clear linear dose-response relationship. Routine screening and 
tailored nutritional interventions should be prioritized in modern MI management 
practices.
