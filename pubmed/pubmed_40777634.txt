BACKGROUND: Hypertension and mental disorders, particularly depression, 
significantly impact Asia's older adult. Alleviating depression in older adult 
hypertensive patients can significantly enhance their quality of life. This 
study evaluates the mental health status of hypertensive patients over 60 who do 
or do not provide intergenerational family support.
METHODS: Using 2020 CHARLS data, we analyzed 4,851 hypertensive patients aged 
≥60. Intergenerational family support was categorized into financial, daily 
caregiving, and emotional support, with mental health measured via the Chinese 
CESD-10. Multivariate linear regression and propensity score matching (PSM) 
assessed mental health changes from different support types. Heterogeneity 
analysis examined differences across age, gender, education, and urban-rural 
areas.
RESULTS: Caregiving (β = -0.78, p < 0.01) and emotional support (β = -0.56, 
p < 0.05) significantly reduced depressive symptoms in older adult hypertensive 
patients, while financial support showed no significant impact. Sensitivity 
tests confirmed these results. Subgroup analyses revealed greater benefits for 
women (emotional support: β = -0.77), rural residents (emotional support: 
β = -0.59), and those aged ≥75 (caregiving support: β = -2.26).
CONCLUSION: Non-material intergenerational support, especially caregiving and 
emotional involvement, is crucial for alleviating depression in older adult 
hypertensive patients, whereas financial support has little effect. Policies 
should prioritize psychosocial interventions over financial aid, particularly 
for vulnerable groups like women, rural residents, and the older adult aged ≥75.
