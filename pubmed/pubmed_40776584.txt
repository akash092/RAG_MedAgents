BACKGROUND: Autonomic dysfunction is a common feature of synucleinopathies such 
as Parkinson's disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), multiple system 
atrophy (MSA), and pure autonomic failure (PAF). Orthostatic hypotension (OH) 
and supine hypertension (SH) are hallmark manifestations of cardiovascular 
autonomic dysfunction that are increasingly recognized as contributors to 
long-term adverse clinical outcomes such as accelerated cognitive decline, motor 
symptom exacerbation, and end-organ damage. Several atypical presentations of 
OH, including coat-hanger pain, cognitive fluctuation, postural instability, 
fatigue, exertional dyspnea, and falls, commonly overlap with motor and 
non-motor features of synucleinopathies. This clinical overlap highlights the 
need for heightened awareness of the diverse and often subtle manifestations of 
OH in affected individuals. Although the general management of OH has been 
addressed in prior literature, a dedicated framework tailored to the 
pathophysiological and clinical nuances specific to synucleinopathies remains 
lacking. SH, despite its high prevalence and significant prognostic 
implications, has received minimal attention in existing reviews and is often 
overlooked in clinical practice.
OBJECTIVE: Given the growing recognition of cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction 
as a potentially modifiable contributor to disease progression and patient 
quality of life, a focused updated review is warranted to inform clinical 
decision-making and guide future research in this evolving area.
RESULTS: This narrative review comprehensively discusses the approach to OH and 
SH in the context of synucleinopathies.
CONCLUSIONS: The key topics addressed are the pathophysiology of OH and SH in 
synucleinopathies, diagnostic criteria and types of OH, diagnostic criteria of 
SH, and management strategies (non-pharmacological, pharmacological, and 
novel/experimental).
