This study aims to develop predictive models for diabetes and hypertension onset 
using personal health records and deep learning to analyze time-series data 
patterns. By leveraging the MyData initiative, the model enhances early 
detection and prevention strategies through personalized prediction. Results 
focus on evaluating performance using AUROC, F1-score, and Recall, highlighting 
its potential for accurate chronic disease prediction. Despite requiring further 
generalization, this framework lays the foundation for real-world applications 
to improve preventive care and advance personalized healthcare.
