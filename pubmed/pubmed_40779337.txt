The Research to Practice column focuses on improving the research critique 
skills and translation of research findings into emergency care clinical 
practice. In this issue, we discuss the findings of Chaudry et al. (2024) on 
risk factors associated with major adverse cardiovascular events after discharge 
in emergency department patients with markedly elevated blood pressures without 
evidence of target organ injury. The investigators conclude that there are a 
number of clinical characteristics and symptoms that build on the clinical 
policy recommendations by the American College of Emergency Physicians on which 
patients should receive routine diagnostic screening or antihypertensive 
treatment while in the emergency department to reduce their risk of adverse 
outcomes.
