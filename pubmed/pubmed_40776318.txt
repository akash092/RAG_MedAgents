While the evidence of damaging effects of hypertension is widely present in the 
literature, the evidence of how the time of index event influences future health 
burden of individuals is less prevalent. By using data from 367,809 patients in 
the TriNetX global collaborative network, we compared the health burdens of 
hypertension initiated during adolescence and young adulthood. Our analysis 
revealed that adolescents face a 30.9% higher risk and a 17.6% greater hazard of 
severe comorbidities, measured by CCI, within a five-year window compared to 
young adults, highlighting the importance of earlier detection and intervention. 
This work is a preliminary step toward a more comprehensive understanding of the 
disease trajectories linked to early-onset hypertension, and by shedding light 
on this issue, we hope to raise awareness among patients, caregivers, and 
policymakers.
