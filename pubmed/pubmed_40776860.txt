BACKGROUND: AT1R (angiotensin II type 1 receptors) are central to the 
renin-angiotensin system and are involved in regulating blood pressure and renal 
physiology. This study introduces [18F]DR29, a fluorine-18-labeled radiotracer 
for positron emission tomography imaging, to enable noninvasive visualization of 
AT1R expression. Its potential applications in understanding AT1R-associated 
renal processes are explored in healthy and hypertensive rat models.
METHODS: Radiolabeling was established, and biodistribution studies were 
conducted on healthy Wistar rats with and without the AT1R antagonist 
candesartan and transporter inhibitors. Dynamic positron emission tomography 
imaging assessed tracer specificity, and feasibility for renal AT1R 
quantification was explored using a hypertensive rat model.
RESULTS: [18F]DR29 was radiolabeled with a yield of 36±6%. High kidney uptake 
was observed, significantly reduced by candesartan (kidney-to-blood ratio, 
0.43±0.01 versus 4.54±1.59 in vehicle, where vehicle refers to saline without 
any treatment). Transporter inhibition protocols targeting organic anion 
transporting polypeptides (liver) and organic anion transporters (kidneys) 
successfully reduced radiotracer clearance, increasing the specific accumulation 
of [18F]DR29 in the kidneys and improving renal imaging contrast. Positron 
emission tomography imaging revealed rapid kidney uptake and stable retention 
over 2 hours. In hypertensive rats, kidney uptake was higher, aligning with AT1R 
expression levels.
CONCLUSIONS: These results support [18F]DR29 as a promising tool for the 
noninvasive evaluation of renal AT1R expression in healthy and diseased states. 
The findings lay the groundwork for clinical translation, offering potential 
applications in diagnosing and managing kidney-related diseases, including 
hypertension and other conditions involving AT1R dysregulation.
