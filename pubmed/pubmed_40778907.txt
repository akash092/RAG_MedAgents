"Shone's syndrome" was identified in 1963 as a constellation of 4 coexisting 
lesions leading to left ventricular inflow and outflow obstruction. This 
congenital heart disease syndrome has hemodynamic consequences throughout the 
lifetime of patients with this syndrome, and these patients often progress to 
requiring advanced therapies. This case series reviews the complex 
decision-making involved in advanced therapy evaluation for this specific 
patient population. We present 8 cases of patients with Shone's syndrome who 
were referred for advanced therapies. Of these patients, 6 patients went on to 
heart transplant alone and 2 patients underwent dual organ transplant. Two 
patients died after transplant. These cases each highlight important 
considerations for transplant in this patient population, including the 
development of pulmonary hypertension, potential need for single vs dual organ 
transplant, and complex pre- and postoperative courses. We emphasize the 
importance of early referral for advanced therapies, multidisciplinary 
evaluation, and individualized care for these complex patients.
