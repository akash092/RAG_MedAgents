PURPOSE: Median Arcuate Ligament Syndrome (MALS) is often underdiagnosed due to 
nonspecific symptoms. This study proposes a CT-based grading system that 
evaluate the association between grade and the incidence of celiac or superior 
mesenteric artery aneurysms.
METHODS: From January 2021 to July 2023, patients exhibiting the characteristic 
hooked appearance on sagittal contrast-enhanced CT, indicative of MALS, were 
included in the study. An age- and sex-matched hypertension screening cohort was 
also recruited as a control group for comparison. They were classified into 
mild-to-moderate and severe stenosis groups based on a 50% stenosis threshold. 
Clinical data (biochemical markers, etc), and imaging parameters (SMA and CA 
diameters) were analyzed to assess their association with MALS severity and 
related complications.
RESULTS: A total of 427 MALS patients and 427 age- and sex-matched controls were 
included (69.1% male; median age 59 years). Radiological assessments showed 
increased abdominal aorta and distal SMA diameters in the MALS group. Higher age 
(p = 0.002), alcohol consumption (p = 0.022), lower triglycerides (p = 0.004), 
and larger SMA diameter (p = 0.001) were associated with MALS severity. Our 
study revealed that while the incidence of severe complications in MALS patients 
does not correlate significantly with age(p = 0.064), it peaks in those aged 
60-69 years(50.8%).
CONCLUSION: Contrast-enhanced CT serves as a valuable tool for classifying the 
severity of MALS and assessing associated complications. MALS severity 
correlates with older age, alcohol consumption, lower triglyceride levels, and 
larger SMA diameter. These findings underscore the importance of integrated 
clinical, biochemical, and imaging assessment in improving diagnostic accuracy, 
risk stratification, and management of MALS.
