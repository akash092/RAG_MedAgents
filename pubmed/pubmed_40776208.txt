To investigate factors affecting the skin sensation of the index finger, we 
analyzed the relationships between body mass index, grip strength, blood 
pressure, and antihypertensive medication use and skin sensation thresholds 
using multiple regression analysis. The results showed that only 
antihypertensive medication use significantly decreased skin sensation 
thresholds. This suggests that antihypertensive medication directly affects skin 
sensation, possibly by increasing sensitivity through its effect on blood flow. 
Future research should examine the effects of medication and changes in blood 
flow on skin sensation thresholds.
