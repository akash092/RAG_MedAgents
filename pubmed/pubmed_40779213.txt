Fumarate hydratase-deficient renal cell carcinoma (FHdRCC) has been classified 
under the new category of molecularly defined RCCs according to the WHO 
classification 2022. Although rare, FHdRCC is an aggressive malignancy with a 
high metastatic potential and poor prognosis, even at early stages. Due to its 
low incidence, no standard therapeutic regimen has been established to date. 
Several phase 2 clinical trials are evaluating combinations of targeted 
therapies in patients with advanced/metastatic disease. These include immune 
checkpoint inhibitors (nivolumab, tislelizumab, sintilimab, avelumab), 
multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (cabozantinib, erlotinib, lenvatinib, axitinib, 
vandetanib), and PARP inhibitors (talazoparib). The most promising combinations 
are nivolumab/cabozantinib (N = 5, objective response rate (ORR): 100%), 
lenvatinib/tislelizumab (N = 14, ORR: 93.3%), bevacizumab/erlotinib (N = 43, 
ORR: 72%), and sintilimab/axitinib (N = 19, ORR: 63.1%). In this review, we will 
provide a detailed overview of ongoing clinical trials, highlighting the roles 
of metabolic and epigenetic reprogramming, as well as pro- oncogenic signaling, 
which together form the backbone for emerging novel targeted treatment 
strategies. Targeting these specific signaling pathways will shift the 
therapeutic landscape toward personalized medicine in metastatic FHdRCC.
