Non-transfusion-dependent thalassemias (NTDT), including thalassemia intermedia 
(TI), are often perceived as less severe than their transfusion-dependent 
counterparts. However, they impose a significant health burden, manifesting in 
complications such as splenomegaly, iron overload, skeletal deformities, and 
cardiopulmonary diseases. This case report aims to enhance understanding of the 
complexities associated with NTDT, particularly regarding the rapid progression 
of infection and the associated challenges in management. We report the case of 
a 62-year-old male farmer from a high-incidence region of thalassemia in China. 
He was diagnosed with αNTDT during a medical evaluation. His baseline hemoglobin 
levels were 7 g/dL at the time of genetic testing for thalassemia and 7.2 g/dL 
upon hospital admission prior to infection. His clinical phenotype was 
classified as thalassemia intermedia. The patient presented with significant 
comorbidities, including chronic anemia, iron overload, and pulmonary 
hypertension, which contributed to his rapid clinical deterioration. Within two 
months of his definitive diagnosis, the patient developed sepsis that rapidly 
progressed to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, leading to death 43 h after 
admission. Sepsis in patients with NTDT progresses rapidly and is associated 
with a high mortality rate, primarily due to the compounded burden of chronic 
anemia, iron overload, and immune dysfunction. This case highlights the need for 
increased clinical awareness to facilitate early diagnosis and prompt 
management, even in αNTDT, which is generally considered a milder disorder 
compared to βNTDT. Enhancing community awareness and implementing proactive 
healthcare strategies, particularly in high-incidence areas, may significantly 
reduce adverse health outcomes in patients with NTDT.

Plain Language Summary: Rapid infection progression and high mortality in NTDT 
due to immune dysfunction.Need for better awareness and early diagnosis in 
underserved areas.Proactive care needed to manage NTDT comorbidities and improve 
outcomes.
