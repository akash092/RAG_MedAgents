BACKGROUND: Insulin resistance has been recognized as a risk factor in the 
pathogenesis of various diseases. The estimated glucose disposal rate (eGDR) has 
been widely validated as a reliable, noninvasive, and cost-effective surrogate 
measure of insulin resistance. However, the relationship between eGDR and 
abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) has not yet been fully elucidated. This study 
sought to investigate the association between the eGDR levels and the risk of 
AAA development.
METHODS: This prospective cohort study enrolled participants from the UK Biobank 
who had complete eGDR measurements and no pre-existing AAA at baseline 
(2006-2010). Participants were stratified into quartiles according to their eGDR 
values. The association between eGDR and AAA was assessed using Cox proportional 
hazards models with results expressed as the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% 
confidence interval (CI). Kaplan-Meier curves were generated to visualize 
cumulative AAA incidence across eGDR quartiles, whereas restricted cubic splines 
(RCSs) were applied to characterize the exposure-response relationship. 
Sensitivity and subgroup analyses were conducted to assess the robustness of the 
findings.
RESULTS: The final analytical cohort comprised 416,800 participants (median age: 
58.0 years (IQR: 50.0-63.0), 45.83% male). During the median follow-up of 13.6 
years, 1881 incident AAA cases were recorded. The Kaplan-Meier curve analysis 
demonstrated a higher cumulative AAA risk with decreasing eGDR quartiles 
(log-rank p < 0.05). The Multivariable Cox model confirmed that lower eGDR 
levels were significantly associated with increased AAA risk. When eGDR was 
assessed as categorical variable, compared with the participants in Quartile 1 
group (reference group), the adjusted HR (95% CI) for those in the Quartile 
2-Quartile 4 groups were 0.76 (0.66-0.87), 0.69 (0.59-0.80), and 0.46 
(0.35-0.62), respectively. When eGDR was evaluated as a continuous variable, a 
1-unit increment in eGDR corresponded to a 12% reduction in AAA risk (HR: 0.88, 
95% CI: 0.85-0.90). After excluding patients with pre-existing diabetes or 
short-term follow-up, the sensitivity analysis produced similar results. A 
subgroup analysis further maintained the association between eGDR and AAA. 
Furthermore, the RCS curve revealed a nonlinear association between eGDR and AAA 
incidence risk (p for nonlinearity ≤ 0.05), identifying a threshold value of 
7.78.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that reduced eGDR levels are independently 
associated with elevated AAA risk, exhibiting a nonlinear dose-response 
relationship characterized by a threshold effect at 7.78. These findings 
position eGDR as a potentially valuable biomarker for AAA risk stratification 
and interventional strategies.
