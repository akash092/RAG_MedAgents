BACKGROUND: The EMPEROR-Preserved clinical trial established empagliflozin as an 
effective therapy in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), yet 
real-world validation in elderly, comorbid populations remain limited. We aimed 
to evaluate the clinical profile, tolerability, and outcomes of empagliflozin in 
a large Belgian HFpEF cohort.
METHODS: This retrospective, single-centre observational study of consecutive 
HFpEF patients (LVEF >50%) initiated on empagliflozin (10 mg daily) between 
April 2023 and April 2024. Baseline characteristics, clinical parameters, 
laboratory values, and outcomes were collected from electronic health records.
RESULTS: Of 798 screened patients, 577 were included (median age 82 years, 58% 
female). Atrial fibrillation (67%) and hypertension (78%) were highly prevalent. 
Empagliflozin use was associated with significant improvements in NYHA 
functional class (NYHA II: 56% to 77%, p < 0.001) and reduction in peripheral 
oedema (26% to 9%, p < 0.001). Modest reductions were observed in systolic blood 
pressure (131 to 130 mmHg, p = 0.017), heart rate (71 to 68 bpm, p = 0.004), 
body weight (76 to 75 kg, p < 0.001), and BMI (27.7 to 27.2 kg/m2, p < 0.001). 
Haemoglobin levels increased (p = 0.002), while renal function declined modestly 
without clinical sequelae. Treatment discontinuation occurred in 2.8% of 
patients, mainly due to genitourinary infections. During a median follow-up 
period of 16 months, the all-cause mortality rate was 6.9%.
CONCLUSION: In real-world elderly and comorbid HFpEF population, empagliflozin 
was well tolerated and associated with improvements in congestion and functional 
status, supporting the external validity of randomised trial findings.
