OBJECTIVES: Primary aldosteronism (PA) is an underdiagnosed yet important 
condition. This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic performance of a combined 
protocol using oral salt loading and postural stimulation tests (PST), named the 
balance study, to confirm and subtype PA.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the data of 402 patients with either 
confirmed PA or essential hypertension who underwent the balance study. 
Biochemical markers were measured using liquid chromatography-tandem mass 
spectrometry. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to assess the 
diagnostic performance. The cut-off values for biochemical markers were 
determined by Youden J's statistics.
RESULTS: For PA confirmation, urinary aldosterone (UALD; area under the curve 
[AUC] 0.894), urinary tetrahydroaldosterone (UTHA; AUC 0.875), the sum of UALD 
and UTHA (SUM; AUC 0.884), and supine plasma aldosterone (PALD; AUC 0.902) 
showed comparable performance. Corresponding cut-offs were: UALD>38 nmol/day, 
UTHA>160 nmol/day, SUM>259 nmol/day, and supine PALD>273 pmol/L. For PA 
subtyping, the difference or ratio between erect and supine PALD in PST achieved 
an AUC of 0.90. An increase of less than 19 pmol/L or less than 5 % from a 
supine to an erect position suggested an aldosterone-producing adenoma.
CONCLUSIONS: This combined protocol using oral salt loading and PST could help 
confirm a diagnosis of PA and predict the subtype. UTHA and supine PALD may add 
value to UALD for PA confirmation, whereas the erect/supine PALD ratio from PST 
could assist in PA subtyping. Further studies are required to validate these 
findings.
