Smart health devices are increasingly used among older adults to monitor their 
health conditions. But less than 4% of users are African American and Latinx 
older adults. We identify facilitators and barriers that impact the use of smart 
health devices among minority older adults through conducting an exploratory 
interview study. The results highlight the need for accessible, supportive, and 
equitable approaches to adopt smart health devices to fulfill its promising in 
meeting the needs of minority older adults.
