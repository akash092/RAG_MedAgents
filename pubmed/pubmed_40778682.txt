OBJECTIVES: Immunity, particularly T lymphocytes, plays an important role in the 
development of arterial hypertension. Moreover, the so-called neuro-immune axis 
has been identified as a crucial crossroads, occurring in the spleen and 
involving placental growth factor as the principal mediator. However, no studies 
in humans have yet investigated the role of the spleen in hypertension and 
vascular damage.
METHODS: In this retrospective, case-control, single-blind study, we enrolled 
patients who had previously undergone elective splenectomy (cases) and subjects 
who had undergone elective cholecystectomy (controls). All subjects underwent 
24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, evaluation of retinal arteriole 
morphology by adaptive optics, capillary density assessment by 
video-capillaroscopy, arterial stiffness measurements, and analysis of T 
lymphocyte subpopulations by flow cytometry.
RESULTS: Fifty patients were included: 25 (50%) cases and 25 (50%) controls. No 
difference in hypertension prevalence (P = 0.39) or cumulative incidence 
(P = 0.79) of new diagnoses was detected. Splenectomized patients displayed 
lower 24-h (P = 0.024) and daytime (P = 0.011) diastolic blood pressure compared 
to cholecystectomized patients. Similar results were obtained for retinal 
structural parameters, capillary density, and arterial stiffness between the 
groups. A significant impact of splenectomy on the relationship between 24-h 
diastolic BP and wall cross-sectional area (P-interaction = 0.019) and forearm 
capillary density recruitment (P-interaction = 0.020) was found. A higher number 
and percentage of CD3+CD8+ T cells were observed in splenectomized patients 
compared to cholecystectomized patients (P = 0.009 and P = 0.001, respectively), 
although no differences in cytokine production patterns were detected.
CONCLUSIONS: For the first time, our results support the role of the spleen in 
blood pressure control in humans. Further and larger studies are required to 
appropriately translate our findings into clinical practice.
