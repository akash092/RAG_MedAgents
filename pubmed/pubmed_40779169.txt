BACKGROUND: Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is an effective 
treatment for various childhood diseases with long-term complications, including 
kidney side effects.
METHODS: We conducted a single-center retrospective study of 213 patients who 
received allogeneic HSCT between February 2011 and December 2023. Patients were 
followed for at least 3 months post-HSCT, with a median follow-up of 2.9 years. 
We evaluated pre- and post-HSCT estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and 
kidney complications.
RESULTS: After HSCT, patients showed significantly higher rates of acute kidney 
injury (21.6% vs. 4.1% pre-HSCT), hypertension (26.8% vs. 5.2% pre-HSCT), and 
tubulopathy (20.2% vs. 5.2% pre-HSCT). The median final eGFR was 144 mL/min/1.73 
m2, which was significantly lower than the pre-HSCT eGFR (155 mL/min/1.73 m2, 
p < 0.0001) and negatively correlated with time after HSCT (Rs =  - 0.177, 
p = 0.009). Eight patients (3.8%) progressed to chronic kidney disease (CKD). 
Factors linked to CKD included inherited bone marrow failure syndromes, 
anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) conditioning, urinary tract infections (UTIs), and 
high urinary BK virus loads. Although the rates of glomerular hyperfiltration 
(GHF) did not change significantly between pre-HSCT (63.8%) and post-HSCT 
(62.4%, p = 0.824), GHF was notable in patients with acute lymphoblastic 
leukemia pre-HSCT and thalassemia post-HSCT. Seventeen patients (8.4%) needed 
ongoing antihypertensive treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: HSCT can cause various kidney complications. GHF is common both 
before and after transplant, and eGFR often declines over time. UTIs, ATG 
conditioning, and inherited bone marrow failure syndromes are important risk 
factors for CKD. Individual factors and infection surveillance should be 
considered in these patients to approach kidney health.
