BACKGROUND: Metabolic syndrome is a constellation of overweight/obesity, 
hypertension, and disturbances in lipid and carbohydrate metabolism. Hypoxic and 
hypobaric conditions of high altitude alter the use of energy producing 
metabolic fuels which may secondarily affect lipid and blood glucose 
concentrations. Thus, this study aims to assess prevalence and risk factors of 
the metabolic syndrome in high and low altitude inhabitants of Nepal.
METHODS: A hospital based descriptive cross-sectional study was carried out 
including 58 individuals from high altitude and 58 individuals from low altitude 
attending Manmohan Memorial Teaching Hospital, Kathmandu. Anthropometric 
measurements and blood pressure were recorded and blood samples were obtained 
for laboratory analysis. The samples were analyzed for fasting glucose, 
triglycerides, total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein cholesterol and low 
density lipoprotein cholesterol as per the standard guidelines.
RESULTS: Among the study group, 31.8% of high altitude and 68.2% of low altitude 
are found to have metabolic syndrome according to National Cholesterol Education 
Program Adult Treatment PlanIII and 35.5% of high altitude and 64.5% of low 
altitude are found to have metabolic syndrome according to HJSS criteria. The 
most prevalent defining components were low high density lipoprotein cholesterol 
(38.8%), high triglyceride (36.2%), elevated fasting blood sugar (33.6%) and 
Hypertension (34.4%). Among the lifestyle factors, alcohol consumption, 
unhealthy diet and physical inactivity were found to be an independent risk 
factors for MetS.
CONCLUSIONS: High altitude inhabitants have significantly lower metabolic 
syndrome than that of low altitude inhabitants because of less physical 
activities in their work and sedentary. Thus, encouragement of food habit, 
healthy lifestyle, and timely health screening and monitoring help in prevention 
of metabolic syndrome.
