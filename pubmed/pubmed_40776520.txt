BACKGROUND: High Blood Pressure, a prevalent condition exacerbated by population 
growth, disproportionately affects the elderly, with over two-thirds of 
individuals aged 65 and above affected. This study aimed to evaluate the 
prevalence and risk factors of high blood pressure among elderly residents of 
Chandragiri Municipality in Kathmandu.
METHODOLOGY: A cross-sectional was applied, and the respondents were selected 
from randomly chosen wards of Chandragiri Municipality. Elderly individuals aged 
over 60 years residing in the area, regardless of permanency, were included. 
Data analysis was conducted using SPSS software, with the Chi-square test 
employed to assess associations between high blood pressure and various risk 
factors at a significance level of 5%.
RESULTS: The study included 418 individuals, of whom 48.8% were currently 
suffering from high blood pressure. The majority was male 55.5% and married 
73.7%, with Chhetri 45.2% and Brahmin 40.7% being the most prevalent ethnic 
groups. Most respondents were illiterate 44.3% and resided in joint families 
68.4%. Reported risk factors for high blood pressure included tobacco smoking 
37.3%, alcohol consumption 36.1%, and non-vegetarian diets 85.9%.
CONCLUSION: Significant relationships were observed between blood pressure and 
age, sex, marital status, tobacco smoking, and alcohol consumption. Conversely, 
religion, ethnicity, education level, family type, BMI, diet type, and physical 
activity did not exhibit noteworthy associations with high blood pressure in 
this sample. These findings underscore the multifactorial nature of high blood 
pressure and its diverse risk factors.
