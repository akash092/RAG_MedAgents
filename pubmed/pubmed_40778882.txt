AIM: This study aimed to assess the prevalence of key cardiometabolic risk 
factors, including hypertension, obesity, dyslipidaemia and diabetes, among 
public school teachers in Vhembe district, Limpopo Province, South Africa.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study design was employed, involving 201 public 
school teachers. Stratified random sampling was used to select teachers on the 
teachers' list obtained from the Department of Education. Anthropometric 
measurement variables, which included including body mass index (BMI), waist 
circumference (WC), and blood pressure (BP), were measured. Biochemical analyses 
included fasting blood profiles, measuring total cholesterol, high-density 
lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), 
triglycerides (TGL) and glucose levels. Statistical analyses were conducted 
using STATA 17, with a significance level set at p < 0.05.
RESULTS: Obesity was observed in 43.7% of participants, with females 
demonstrating a significantly (P = 0.000) higher prevalence (62.5%) than males 
(20.2%). Additionally, 43.2% of participants presented with high-risk WC, with 
males (50.5%) being more affected than females (37.5%). Stage 1 systolic blood 
pressure hypertension was identified in 18.4% of participants, and 23.8% had 
diabetes. Dyslipidaemia was marked by elevated LDL, low HDL and increased 
triglyceride levels, with a higher prevalence in females.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings indicate a substantial burden of cardiometabolic risk 
factors among teachers in the Vhembe district. Urgent implementation of targeted 
interventions, including health promotion, lifestyle modification, and routine 
health screenings, is imperative. Further research is needed to validate these 
findings across different regions in South Africa.
