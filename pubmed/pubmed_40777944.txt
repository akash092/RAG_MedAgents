BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to explore the application effect of 
task-oriented multi-dimensional nursing intervention in patients with coronary 
atherosclerotic heart disease (CAD) and concurrent hypertension.
METHODOLOGY: The clinical data of 196 patients with CAD and concurrent 
hypertension in our hospital between January 2019 and January 2022 were 
retrospectively analysed. The patients receiving task-oriented multi-dimensional 
nursing were set as study group (n=98), while those given routine nursing as 
control group (n=98). The two groups were compared in the Hamilton Anxiety Scale 
(HAMA) scores, left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD), 36-Item Short 
Form Health Survey (SF-36) scores, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), 
Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD) scores, systolic blood pressure (SBP), 
treatment compliance and incidence rates of adverse events.
RESULTS: After intervention, study group showed lower HAMA and HAMD scores, SBP 
and LVEDD, but higher SF-36 scores and LVEF than control group (P<0.05). The 
treatment compliance rate was higher in control group than that in study group 
(92.86% vs. 80.61%), while an opposite result was detected in the total 
incidence rate 5.10% vs. 13.27%, P<0.05).
CONCLUSION: Multidimensional nursing benefits CAD patients with hypertension, 
improving emotions, compliance, and quality of life, reducing adverse events, 
and promoting recovery. Recommended for clinical use.
