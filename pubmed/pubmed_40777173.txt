BACKGROUND: Suboptimal diet remains a major threat to chronic kidney diseases 
(CKD) and hypertension, however, the burden of diet-attributable CKD due to 
hypertension (HCKD) has been poorly quantified and reported. This study aimed to 
provide a comprehensive and up-to-date view of global temporal and geographical 
trends in diet-attributable HCKD burden.
METHODS: Data on diet-attributable HCKD burden were extracted from the Global 
Burden of Disease Study (GBD) 2021. Number and age-standardized rates (ASR) of 
mortality and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) with their average annual 
percentage change (AAPC) were used to describe the diet-attributable HCKD 
burden. Decomposition analysis was employed to assess the contributions of 
aging, population, and epidemiological changes to HCKD burden.
RESULTS: Globally, the ASR of mortality (ASMR) and DALYs (ASDR) of 
diet-attributable HCKD among adults aged ≥25 years increased from 3.7 (95% 
uncertainty interval [UI]: 2.0-5.6) and 91.7 (50.1-140.1) per 100,000 population 
in 1990 to 4.3 (2.3-6.7) and 101.2 (56.0-154.5) per 100,000 population in 2021, 
respectively. Both mortality and DALYs of diet-attributable HCKD burden in 2021 
were higher among males than females. Low fruit and low vegetable intake 
contributed the most to the diet-attributable HCKD burden. The highest ASMR and 
ASDR of diet-attributable HCKD were observed in Central Sub-Saharan Africa, 
whereas the lowest were observed in Eastern Europe. The older adult population 
had higher mortality and DALYs than other age groups. Decomposition analysis 
showed that population growth mainly contributed to HCKD burden, particularly in 
low SDI regions.
CONCLUSION: The diet-attributable HCKD burden is increasing at an alarming rate 
globally, especially in low SDI countries and older adults. This study 
emphasizes the urgent need for rigorous public health interventions to change 
unhealthy dietary behaviors and decrease diet-attributable HCKD burden 
worldwide.
