BACKGROUND: Hypertension is a significant public health concern in Nepal, 
particularly in rural areas with limited healthcare access. Adherence to 
antihypertensive medication is critical for adequate blood pressure control and 
reducing cardiovascular complications. This study aims to assess medication 
adherence among hypertensive patients and identify associated factors.
METHODS: A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted in Namobuddha 
Municipality, Nepal. A total of 2,024 individuals aged 30 years and older were 
screened, of which 1,008 were identified as hypertensive. After applying the 
eligibility criteria, 478 participants were included in the final analysis. 
Medication adherence was assessed using the Hill-Bone Compliance to High Blood 
Pressure Therapy (HBCHBPT) Scale. Data were collected through face-to-face 
interviews using standardized questionnaires and analyzed using STATA version 
17. Multivariate linear regression was performed to determine factors 
influencing adherence.
RESULTS: Among 478 participants, the mean age was 62.12 years, with 55.86% being 
female. Most participants (91.63%) were on a single antihypertensive medication, 
and 57.11% had uncontrolled hypertension. The mean medication adherence score 
was 34.57 Â± 1.90. In multivariate analysis, higher hypertension knowledge scores 
were significantly associated with better medication adherence (? = 0.07, 95% 
CI: 0.01, 0.13, p = 0.03). Other factors, including age, gender, education, 
ethnicity, marital status, smoking, alcohol use, physical activity, and social 
support, were not significantly associated with adherence.
CONCLUSIONS: The study found that medication adherence among hypertensive 
patients was suboptimal, with a significant proportion having uncontrolled blood 
pressure. Higher hypertension knowledge was associated with better adherence, 
highlighting the importance of patient education. Strengthening educational 
interventions and counseling strategies may improve adherence and, consequently, 
hypertension control.
