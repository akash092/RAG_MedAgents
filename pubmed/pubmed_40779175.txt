Cryptococcal meningitis (CM) is a life-threatening fungal infection of the 
central nervous system, with intracranial hypertension being a major contributor 
to mortality. Ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunting has been established as a 
crucial intervention for managing elevated intracranial pressure; however, 
comprehensive long-term prognostic data for CM patients undergoing VP shunt 
placement remain limited. This study aimed to evaluate the long-term outcomes of 
VP shunting in patients with CM through a retrospective analysis. A 
retrospective cohort study was conducted involving patients diagnosed with CM, 
with a follow-up period of 48 weeks. Demographic characteristics, 
disease-related parameters, and laboratory findings were collected and analyzed 
at multiple time points. Of the 106 CM patients enrolled, 77 underwent VP 
shunting, while 29 received conservative management. No significant differences 
were observed between the two groups in terms of hospitalization duration, 
cryptococcal clearance rate, time to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) culture 
negativity, or recurrence rate. The VP shunt group demonstrated a rapid 
reduction in intracranial pressure (ICP), achieving normalization by week 4 and 
maintaining a significantly lower level than the conservative group at week 12. 
CSF cryptococcal counts were comparable between the groups throughout the 
follow-up period. However, the VP shunt group exhibited persistently elevated 
CSF white blood cell (WBC) counts and protein levels up to 48 weeks, along with 
transiently lower glucose levels in the early stages, which normalized by week 
24. VP shunting effectively controls intracranial hypertension and accelerates 
cryptococcal clearance in patients with CM; however, it does not significantly 
alter the long-term clinical prognosis, and the clinical significance of 
postoperative CSF alterations may be limited.
