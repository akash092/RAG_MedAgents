We report two female siblings, a 13-month-old and a newborn, with multiple 
anomalies including hypoplastic kidneys, severe growth restriction, facial 
dysmorphism, and alopecia, both found to be homozygous for the c.587 T>C variant 
in ZPR1. Their clinical features are strikingly similar to those previously 
reported in a patient who was homozygous for the same variant. Our report 
confirms that homozygosity for c.587 T>C in ZPR1 underlies a novel genetic 
syndrome with autosomal recessive inheritance and that c.587 T>C is a founder 
variant for ZPR1 disorder in the Middle Rio Grande Valley. We expand our 
understanding of the phenotype by describing abnormal glucose homeostasis, 
growth hormone resistance, and progressive liver disease with decompensated 
portal hypertension and esophageal varices despite the absence of cirrhosis.
