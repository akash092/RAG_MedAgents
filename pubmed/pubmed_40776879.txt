BACKGROUND: Nutcracker syndrome is a rare clinical condition characterised by 
the compression of the left renal vein (LRV). This syndrome results in venous 
hypertension and a variety of symptoms, including haematuria and abdominal pain. 
We reported an unusual case of combined nutcracker syndrome caused by the 
compression of both branches of a circumaortic LRV, an anatomical variant.
METHODS: An 18-year-old female presented with chronic abdominal pain and 
intermittent haematuria. Laboratory tests and imaging studies including 
contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis were 
performed to investigate the cause. A comprehensive literature review of similar 
cases was conducted using PubMed.
RESULTS: CT showed circumaortic LRV with the anterior branch compressed between 
the superior mesenteric artery and the aorta, and the posterior branch 
compressed between the aorta and the spine. This finding confirmed the diagnosis 
of combined nutcracker syndrome. The patient opted for conservative management, 
which improved her symptoms. Literature review identified only five other cases 
of combined nutcracker syndrome owing to circumaortic LRV.
CONCLUSIONS: Combined nutcracker syndrome is primarily diagnosed through imaging 
and should be considered in patients with chronic abdominal pain and haematuria, 
especially when anatomic variants such as circumaortic LRV are present. CT 
allows accurate visualisation of venous compression and the anatomic structures 
involved.
