OBJECTIVES: While the prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after 
road traffic accidents (RTA) has been widely studied, there is a gap in research 
in the context of China. Therefore, this study aimed to provide a pooled 
estimation of PTSD prevalence after RTA based on Chinese data and compare it to 
existing international prevalence.
METHODS: A systematic literature search of English and Chinese databases was 
performed from their inception dates to December 31, 2024. Chinese patients 
admitted to a hospital or emergency department after RTA, and without traumatic 
brain injury following RTA or without PTSD before RTA were included, regardless 
of type of RTA and whether fracture was sustained. Subgroup analyses were 
performed on the basis on demographics, assessment methods, income, and 
comorbidity.
RESULTS: The inclusion criteria were met by 21 studies. The pooled prevalence of 
acute stress disorder (ASD) and PTSD was 30% (95% CI, 22%-37%) and 27% (95% 
CI,22%-32%), respectively, which is higher than the global prevalence of 16% ASD 
and 22% PTSD. The transition rate of ASD to PTSD was 77% (95% CI, 63%-91%). 
Females, older adults, and those with lower income had a higher prevalence of 
PTSD. In addition, the prevalence of PTSD increased with age. Older survivors 
with comorbidities including anxiety, depression, complication (such as pain, 
hemorrhagic shock, hypoxemia), diabetes, and hypertension were more likely to 
suffer from PTSD than older survivors without those comorbidities.
CONCLUSIONS: PTSD after RTA is common, with more than one in four RTA survivors 
reporting PTSD. Pooled prevalence was higher than that of meta-analysis that had 
no restrictions on world region.
