IMPORTANCE: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) and vascular risk factors are 
associated with cognitive impairment, but it is unknown if individuals with 
vascular risk factors experience worse cognitive outcomes after TBI.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate cognitive function among patients with TBI with vs 
without comorbid preinjury vascular risk factors.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This prospective cohort study examined 
individuals with TBI enrolled in the Transforming Research and Clinical 
Knowledge in TBI (TRACK-TBI) Study between February 26, 2014, and August 8, 
2018, with a 1-year follow-up. Analyses were conducted February 26, 2024, to May 
29, 2025.
EXPOSURES: Vascular risk factors (ie, hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, 
and smoking).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Participants underwent a 5-test cognitive assessment 
at 2 weeks, 6 months, and 1 year postinjury; tests were combined into a global 
cognitive factor score in primary analyses and examined individually in 
secondary analyses. Inverse probability of attrition-weighted generalized 
estimating equations adjusted for age, sex, race, ethnicity, education, TBI 
severity, prior TBI, and psychiatric history were used to estimate the 
associations.
RESULTS: The 1313 participants were a mean (SD) age of 38.7 (16.4) years, 428 
were female (32.6%), 885 were male (67.4%), 393 had never smoked (29.9%), 221 
had hypertension (16.8%), 98 had diabetes (7.5%), and 116 had hyperlipidemia 
(8.8%). Both participants with and without vascular risk factors had improvement 
in cognition over the first year postinjury. Compared with individuals without 
diabetes, participants with diabetes had lower global cognitive factor scores at 
2 weeks postinjury (mean z-score difference, -0.25; 95% CI, -0.45 to -0.04), 
worse executive functioning at 2 weeks postinjury, and less improvement on 
processing speed over the first-year postinjury. There were no significant 
differences in cognitive performance comparing participants with vs without 
hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and smoking. Individuals with 2 or more vascular 
risk factors (compared with no vascular risk factors) had lower global factor 
score at 2 weeks postinjury (mean difference, -0.21; 95% CI, -0.19 to -0.07) and 
worse verbal episodic memory immediate recall, executive functioning, and 
processing speed at 2 weeks, but similar improvements in cognitive performance 
over the first-year postinjury.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study of individuals with TBI, those 
with diabetes displayed poorer global cognitive function and executive 
functioning 2 weeks after TBI and recovered less in processing speed over the 
first-year postinjury. Given the modifiable nature of comorbid vascular risk 
factors, future work interrogating postinjury changes in vascular risk factor 
burden, over longer follow-up, is warranted.
