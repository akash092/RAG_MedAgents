Kidneys are functionally affected by the diseases of other organs. Here, we 
present an elderly predialysis patient with a functioning kidney for 10 years of 
nephrological follow-up despite many comorbidities. A 75-year-old male patient 
with a medical history of hypertension for 15 years and 60 pack years of 
cigarette smoking, was diagnosed as muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) and 
synchronous centrally located clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) in the 
left kidney. At admission, the patient had an Estimated Glomerular Filtration 
Rate (eGFR) (CKD-EPI-cre) of 54mL/min/1.73m2, after left nephrectomy eGFR of the 
patient decreased to 35 mL/min/1.73m2. After ten years of follow-up, the 
patient's right kidney had been functional with a eGFR of 24 mL/min/1.73m2 
despite radical cystectomy with urinary diversion, radical nephrectomy, heavy 
smoking, [cardiorenal syndrome, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and 
hypertension. It is well known that comorbidities such as hypertension, smoking, 
cancers, infections, pulmonary and heart diseases contribute to irreversible 
kidney damage and are additive to decreasing kidney function. Appropriate and 
early diagnosis and treatment of these comorbidities permit healthy aging of the 
kidneys without the need for dialysis.
