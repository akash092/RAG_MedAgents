BACKGROUND: Kidney stone incidence and recurrence are increasing, which poses 
significant health problems. The Advanced Lung Cancer Inflammation Index (ALI) 
combines body mass index (BMI), albumin, and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio 
(NLR). It was first created to predict outcomes for cancer patients. Recently, 
it has been studied as an indicator of overall inflammation and nutrition in 
other diseases, such as chronic kidney disease, heart failure, acute myocardial 
infarction, and asthma. This study aimed to evaluate the association between ALI 
scores and kidney stone risk in adult men, and to assess the potential utility 
of ALI as an indicative biomarker.
METHODS: We analyzed data from 5,429 male participants in the National Health 
and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES, 2007-2018). Weighted logistic 
regression models were used to examine the relationship between ALI scores and 
the risk of kidney stones. Non-linear associations were further explored with 
smoothed curve fitting. The predictive value of ALI was assessed using receiver 
operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Subgroup analyses were conducted 
to evaluate the consistency of findings across different demographic and 
clinical characteristics.
RESULTS: Out of all participants, 572 (10.5%) had a history of kidney stones. 
For every one-unit increase in ALI score, the risk of having kidney stones 
decreased by 22.7% (odds ratio = 0.773, 95% CI: 0.675-0.885, P < 0.001). The 
smooth curve analysis showed a non-linear inverse relationship. The protective 
effect was stronger when ALI scores were low. Subgroup analyses showed stronger 
relationships for men aged 60-80, overweight men, former smokers, and men 
without hypertension, diabetes, or cardiovascular disease. ROC analysis showed 
ALI had moderate accuracy in predicting kidney stones (AUC = 0.770).
CONCLUSION: ALI scores were independently linked to a lower risk of kidney 
stones, especially in men without metabolic diseases. As a simple inflammation 
and nutrition marker, ALI could help identify people who have a higher risk. 
However, due to the cross-sectional design of this study, a causal relationship 
between ALI and kidney stone risk cannot be established. Further prospective 
studies are needed to validate these findings.
