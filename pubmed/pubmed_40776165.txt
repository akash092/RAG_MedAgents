High Blood Pressure (HBP) is a disorder characterized by elevated levels of 
pressure in blood vessels and constituted one of the risk factors for 
cardiovascular diseases and mortality. This work proposed the development of the 
Expert System for the Diagnosis of Secondary HBP, an innovative tool capable of 
providing accurate and personalized diagnoses by considering multiple factors. 
The system evaluated blood pressure levels to classify the degree of HBP and 
analyzed various clinical parameters to identify possible grounds of secondary 
hypertension.
