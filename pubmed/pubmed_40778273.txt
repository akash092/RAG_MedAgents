INTRODUCTION: Incomplete clinical success after unilateral adrenalectomy for 
primary aldosteronism (PA) remains a significant challenge, often characterized 
by persistent hypertension despite biochemical remission.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop and validate a preoperative predictive 
nomogram to estimate the probability of incomplete clinical success in PA 
patients undergoing unilateral adrenalectomy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on 58 PA patients 
who underwent adrenalectomy. Independent predictors of non-complete clinical 
success were identified using multivariate logistic regression. A nomogram was 
developed based on age, highest systolic blood pressure (SBP), and 
lateralization index (LI). Model performance was evaluated through the 
concordance index (C-index), calibration plots, and decision curve analysis, 
with internal validation performed via bootstrapping (1,000 resamples).
RESULTS: Age (OR 1.117), highest SBP (OR 1.241), and LI (OR 1.044) were 
independently associated with incomplete clinical success. The nomogram showed 
strong discriminative ability (C-index: 0.829) and good calibration. Internal 
validation confirmed its reliability (AUC: 0.844, sensitivity 84.2%, specificity 
75.0%).
CONCLUSION: This nomogram offers a reliable, easy-to-use tool for preoperative 
risk stratification of PA patients, facilitating personalized postoperative 
management. External validation in multicenter cohorts is warranted.
