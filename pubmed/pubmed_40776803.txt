AIMS: This study investigated the prevalence and concordance of cardiometabolic 
risk markers among couples after a gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM)-affected 
pregnancy. It also examined whether selected demographic, socioeconomic and 
health behavioural factors could explain within-couple associations.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study design was used. We included 
health examinations and questionnaire data from couples assessed 12 weeks after 
a pregnancy affected by GDM. We determined the prevalence and concordance of 
cardiometabolic risk markers (overweight or obesity, high waist circumference, 
metabolic syndrome, impaired fasting glucose [≥6.1 mmol/L], and stage 1 
hypertension or more [≥130 mmHg/≥80 mmHg], along with health behaviour [dietary 
quality and physical activity]).
RESULTS: A total of 196 couples were included. Overweight or obesity was present 
in 63.3% of women and 71.9% of partners, with concordance observed in 50.5% of 
couples. By comparison, 78.6% of women and 55.1% of partners had high waist 
circumferences, which was concordant in 48.5% of couples. Metabolic syndrome was 
identified in 9.2% of women and 24.0% of partners, suggesting a higher 
occurrence among partners with concordance in 5.1% of couples. Impaired fasting 
glucose was observed in 7.7% of women and 9.2% of partners, with concordance in 
1.5% of couples. Stage 1 hypertension or more was observed in 31.1% of the 
women, 55.6% of the partners and concordant in 8.2% of couples. Cardiometabolic 
risk markers were associated within couples.
CONCLUSIONS: Detecting GDM in women may serve as an opportunity to identify 
partners at risk, underscoring the potential of couple-based or family-focused 
interventions.
