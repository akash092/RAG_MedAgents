BACKGROUND:  Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), including hypertension (HTN), have 
emerged among people living with HIV (PLHIV) as the most important prevalent 
contributors of non-AIDS-related mortality. Moreover, HTN itself is a modifiable 
risk factor for other CVDs. Data are limited regarding the prevalence of HTN and 
associated factors among PLHIV in Lesotho.
AIM:  To determine the prevalence of HTN and associated factors among PLHIV 
attending Senkatana ART Clinic.
SETTING:  The study was carried out at Senkatana ART Clinic in urban Maseru, 
Lesotho.
METHODS:  A cross-sectional study was conducted from February to July 2022. Data 
were analysed using SAS statistical software (v9.4) and Microsoft Excel. To 
determine HTN prevalence, blood pressure (BP) was measured, and a questionnaire 
was administered to participants who were randomly selected using the lottery 
method from the clinic's daily attendance list. Multiple logistic regression was 
used to assess factors associated with HTN in PLHIV while controlling for 
potentially confounding factors.
RESULTS:  The prevalence of HTN was 57% (exact 95% CI: 51.2%, 62.7%). Of those 
with HTN, 33.3% were newly diagnosed during this study (exact 95% CI: 26.3%, 
40.9%), while 69% of those previously diagnosed with HTN had uncontrolled HTN at 
enrollment (exact 95% CI: 60.0%, 77.6%). Age older than 50 years (p  0.0001) and 
a body mass index (BMI) of 25.0 kg/m2 or higher (p  0.0002) were independently 
associated with HTN.
CONCLUSION:  Hypertension was highly prevalent and poorly controlled. Factors 
associated with HTN in PLHIV were older age and higher BMI. The study's findings 
support models of comprehensive healthcare delivery.
