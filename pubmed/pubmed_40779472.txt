A Case of Thrombocytopenia Caused by Gynostemma Pentaphyllum.

Ding L, Lu T, Zhan L.

BACKGROUND: The clinical harm of thrombocytopenia is significant, including 
bleeding, anemia, thrombosis, and increased risk of infection. Gynostemma 
pentaphyllum, a prominent traditional Chinese medicine, is clinically utilized 
to treat various conditions such as diabetes mellitus, hepatic fibrosis, 
hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and other disorders. This report details a case of 
a cerebral infarction patient who developed significant thrombocytope-nia 
following treatment with Gynostemma pentaphyllum. This case underscores the 
importance of monitoring platelet counts in patients using Gynostemma 
pentaphyllum.
METHODS: The patient's platelet counts were measured using a fully automated 
blood cell counter. Her whole blood cell concentrations were assessed before and 
after discontinuation of Gynostemma pentaphyllum.
RESULTS: Initial blood tests revealed leukocyte and platelet concentrations of 
3.27 x 109/L and 6.0 x 109/L, respectively, after the patient had used 
Gynostemma pentaphyllum continuously for over three months. 
Post-discontinuation, two subsequent blood tests showed leukocyte counts of 5.26 
x 109/L and 5.52 x 109/L, and platelet counts rebounded to 156 x 109/L.
CONCLUSIONS: Gynostemma pentaphyllum may induce thrombocytopenia. Patients on 
long-term therapy with this medication should have their platelet levels closely 
monitored.
