PURPOSE: Decompressive craniectomy (DC) reduces mortality in traumatic brain 
injury (TBI), but its impact on functional outcomes remains debated. DC is 
classified as primary or secondary; however, most studies analyze both together. 
This study aims to compare clinical and epidemiological differences between 
primary and secondary DC.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study analyzed severe TBI patients requiring 
primary vs. secondary DC admitted to our Intensive Care Unit (ICU) (2014-2024). 
Epidemiological, clinical, and radiological variables were evaluated.
RESULTS: Among 312 ICU-admitted TBI patients, 72 underwent DC (45 primary, 33 
secondary). Primary DC was performed intraoperatively during mass evacuation 
without prior intracranial pressure (ICP) assessment, while secondary DC was 
performed for refractory intracranial hypertension (ICH). Patients who underwent 
primary DC showed signs of more severe injury at admission, which was associated 
with higher mortality.
CONCLUSION: Secondary DC patients had a better initial prognosis and ICU course, 
likely due to the selection of less severe cases. Higher mortality in the 
primary DC group may reflect the greater severity of the initial injury rather 
than the negative impact of early intervention. A predictive model incorporating 
clinical (hemodynamic instability) and radiological (perimesencephalic cistern 
collapse, midline shift) criteria effectively differentiates primary DC 
candidates (AUC = 0.821, p < 0.0001).
