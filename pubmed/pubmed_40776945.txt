BACKGROUND: Coronary heart disease (CHD) arises from a complex interplay of 
genetic and environmental factors. This study examines the influence of 
endothelial lipase gene polymorphisms (rs2000813 and rs3813082) and their 
interactions with traditional cardiovascular risk factors on CHD susceptibility.
METHODS: This retrospective case-control study enrolled 900 CHD patients and 900 
control subjects. We evaluated associations between conventional cardiovascular 
risk factors and polymorphisms at the rs2000813 and rs3813082 loci in the 
endothelial lipase gene. Multifactorial analysis was used to assess interactions 
between traditional risk factors and these polymorphisms. Additionally, we 
developed a predictive model integrating genetic variants and clinical variables 
to estimate CHD risk.
RESULTS: No significant differences were observed in the distribution of 
rs2000813 genotypes (CC, CT, TT) and alleles (C, T), or rs3813082 genotypes (AA, 
AC, CC) and alleles (A, C) between CHD and control groups, including among 
males. However, in females with CHD, the rs2000813CT genotype was significantly 
more frequent (49.30%) than in controls (37.80%), whereas the CC genotype was 
less frequent in the CHD group (45.00%) than in controls (55.20%). Multivariate 
logistic regression identified the rs2000813CT genotype, hypertension, ages ≥60 
years, body mass index (BMI) values ≥28 kg/m2, total cholesterol (TC) ≥6.2 
mmol/L, and apolipoprotein B (ApoB) ≥1.1 g/L as potential risk factors for CHD 
in women (p < 0.05). Gene-environment interaction analysis revealed that BMI 
exerted the greatest influence (12.62%). A predictive model incorporating 
rs2000813 genotypes estimated CHD risk in women with an area under the curve 
(AUC) of 0.804.
CONCLUSIONS: The rs2000813CT endothelial lipase genotype is potentially 
associated with an increased CHD risk in females, whereas the CC genotype may 
confer a protective effect. Integrating endothelial lipase gene variants with 
traditional cardiovascular risk factors enhances CHD risk prediction in women. 
Synergistic interaction between endothelial lipase polymorphisms and 
environmental factors appears to influence CHD occurrence in this population.
