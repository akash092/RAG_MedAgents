BACKGROUND: The prevalence of hypertension in children is rising globally, with 
early-onset high blood pressure linked to future cardiovascular risk. 
Identifying early risk markers beyond obesity and high salt intake is necessary. 
Although cost-effective indicators of insulin resistance (IR), such as TyG and 
METS-IR, have been associated with new-onset hypertension in adults, their links 
with pediatric hypertension, particularly specific phenotypes of hypertension 
remain unclear.
METHODS: 12,087 individuals aged 7-17 years from the 2017 China National 
Nutrition and Health Surveillance of Children and Lactating Women were included. 
Hypertension was defined as systolic blood pressure (SBP) and/or diastolic blood 
pressure (DBP) ≥95th percentile for sex, age, and height. Isolated systolic 
hypertension (ISH), defined as SBP ≥95th and DBP <95th percentile. Isolated 
diastolic hypertension (IDH), defined as DBP ≥95th and SBP <95th percentile. 
Systolic-diastolic hypertension (SDH), defined as both SBP and DBP ≥95th 
percentile. The associations of TyG and METS-IR with hypertension phenotypes 
were investigated using multivariable logistic regression and restricted cubic 
spline regression.
RESULTS: TyG and METS-IR were positively associated with hypertension and all 
its phenotypes after multivariable adjustment. Treated as continuous variables, 
each 1-unit rise in TyG corresponds to 44%, 47%, and 61% higher chance of ISH, 
IDH, and SDH, respectively (odds ratio [OR]: 1.44, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 
1.31-1.59; OR: 1.47, 95%CI: 1.21-1.79; OR: 1.61, 95%CI: 1.35-1.91); each 1-unit 
rise in METS-IR corresponds to 10%, 6%, and 12% higher chance of ISH, IDH, and 
SDH, respectively (OR: 1.10, 95%CI: 1.09-1.12; OR: 1.06, 95%CI: 1.03-1.08; OR: 
1.12, 95%CI: 1.10-1.14). Consistent positive associations were observed across 
different subgroups for ISH and SDH, whereas this association for IDH was not 
statistically significant in several subgroups (e.g., age ≥12 years, sufficient 
sleep, daily exercise). TyG and METS-IR exhibited linear dose-response 
relationships with all hypertension phenotypes (p-nonlinear >0.10).
CONCLUSION: TyG and METS-IR show strong relationships with three kinds of 
hypertension phenotypes. They are promising markers that may contribute to the 
primary prevention of hypertension in pediatric populations.
