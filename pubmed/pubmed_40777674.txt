Drug-induced lupus (DIL) is a rare autoimmune condition triggered by certain 
medications, most commonly hydralazine and procainamide. DIL can manifest after 
a few weeks or even after several years of drug exposure. We present a case of a 
61-year-old female with hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus who developed 
progressive polyarthritis, myalgia, and fatigue that developed over a year after 
three years of hydralazine use. Laboratory findings revealed anemia, leukopenia, 
elevated inflammatory markers, an anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) titer of 1:2560, 
and anti-histone antibodies of 4.9 units. A false-positive immunoglobulin M 
(IgM) Lyme antibody complicated the diagnostic workup. Discontinuation of 
hydralazine and initiation of corticosteroid and methotrexate resulted in 
resolution after six weeks, confirming the diagnosis of hydralazine-induced 
lupus.
