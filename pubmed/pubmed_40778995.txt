BACKGROUND: Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is characterized by 
pathological vascular remodeling driven by pulmonary artery smooth muscle cell 
(PASMC) proliferation. While METTL14-mediated N6-methyladenosine (m6A) RNA 
modification has been implicated in PAH, the upstream regulators and downstream 
effectors linking m6A to PASMC dysregulation remain unclear. This study 
investigates the role of SETD2, a histone methyltransferase, in driving 
METTL14-dependent m6A modifications to promote PAH via Piezo1 and 
transglutaminase 2 (TGM2).
METHODS: C57BL/6 mice were subjected to hypoxia, and pulmonary artery smooth 
muscle cells (PASMCs) were periodically stretched to establish PAH models in 
vivo and in vitro. The epigenetic regulation of METTL14 by SETD2-mediated 
H3K36me3 was investigated by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). Methylated 
RNA immunoprecipitation sequence (MeRIP-seq), RNA-seq, and dual-luciferase 
reporter gene data were used to determine whether METTL14 enhances the 
expression of Piezo1 in an m6A-dependent manner. To analyze comparisons between 
multiple datasets, one-way ANOVA was used.
RESULTS: METTL14 overexpression increased PASMC proliferation by 1.45-fold (vs. 
controls) and elevated global m6A levels by 1.73-fold in total RNA and 1.43-fold 
in poly A + RNA. SETD2-driven H3K36me3 histone modification upregulated METTL14 
expression by 1.76-fold, amplifying m6A deposition. In hypoxia-induced PAH mice, 
METTL14 overexpression exacerbated hemodynamic severity, increasing right 
ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) by 29% and mean pulmonary arterial pressure 
(mPAP) by 33% (vs. hypoxia alone). SETD2 knockout in PASMCs reduced RVSP by 24%, 
mPAP by 28%, and pulmonary artery media thickness (PAMT) by 29%, while 
decreasing m6A levels by 48%. Piezo1 mRNA stability increased by 2.36-fold via 
METTL14-mediated m6A modification at adenosine 1080, elevating Piezo1 protein 
expression by 3.58-fold in PASMCs. Piezo1 overexpression increased intracellular 
Ca²⁺ influx, driving TGM2 activity by 1.79-fold and restoring PASMC 
proliferation despite SETD2 deficiency.
CONCLUSIONS: This study identifies a novel SETD2/H3K36me3/METTL14/m6A axis that 
stabilizes Piezo1 mRNA, promoting Ca²⁺-dependent TGM2 activation and PASMC 
proliferation in PAH. Targeting this pathway-via SETD2, METTL14, or Piezo1 
inhibition-may offer therapeutic potential to ameliorate vascular remodeling in 
PAH.
