Background and aimsThe diagnosis of transient ischaemic attack (TIA) and minor 
stroke can be challenging. Current diagnostic criteria for TIA disqualify 
atypical clinical presentations which may nevertheless be associated with 
objective cerebral ischaemia on DWI-MRI. We aimed to: (1) ascertain the 
proportion of DWI-positive patients with atypical clinical presentations; and 
(2) identify clinical factors predicting DWI positivity.MethodsWe 
retrospectively reviewed case notes of consecutive patients with suspected TIA 
or minor stroke undergoing MRI at our comprehensive stroke centre. We identified 
clinical factors predicting DWI positivity using multivariable logistic 
regression.ResultsWe included 1615 patients. Of 442 (27.4%) who were 
DWI-positive, 38.5% had atypical presentations; common symptoms included 
headache (present in 17%), unsteadiness (15%), positive sensory symptoms (11%), 
presyncope (10%), confusion (9%) and vertigo (8%). Symptoms independently 
associated with DWI-positivity included weakness (OR 1.30 95% CI 1.01-1.67), 
dysarthria (OR 2.05 CI 1.56-2.70), and ataxia (OR 3.76 CI 2.27-6.21). 
Fluctuating symptoms (present in 21.5%) predicted DWI positivity (OR 1.37 CI 
1.04-1.81), but sudden onset (80.1%) did not (OR 1.05, CI 0.80-1.38). Risk 
factors associated with DWI positivity included increasing age (OR 1.02/year CI 
1.01-1.02), hypertension (OR 1.61 CI 1.23-2.11), diabetes (OR 1.40 CI 
1.04-1.90), and smoking (OR 1.67 CI 1.17-2.37). DWI-positive patients had 
significantly more risk factors (mean 2.65 vs 1.95 p=<0.001).ConclusionsOver 
one-third of people with MRI DWI-confirmed TIA or minor stroke present with 
atypical symptoms. MRI-DWI is essential to diagnose cerebral ischaemia in 
patients with atypical symptoms, particularly in those with vascular risk 
factors.
