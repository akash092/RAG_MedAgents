OBJECTIVE: This paper seeks to investigate factors related to time delays for 
diagnosis and treatment in breast cancer patients at Parirenyatwa Hospital in 
Zimbabwe and subsequently evaluate the effects of presentation and diagnosis 
delays on cancer stage.
METHODS: The study was done for 379 patients with histologically diagnosed 
invasive breast cancer, from 2015 through to 2019. The study sought to identify 
factors associated with the time delays ( months)using parametric and 
non-parametric methods, depending on whether underlying assumptions of such 
tests are met. A multiple logistic regression model was also used to analyse the 
association between factors, primary delay, secondary delay variables and cancer 
stage.
RESULTS: The median of the primary, secondary and treatment delay were found to 
be 7.6, 1 and 0.4 months respectively. Rural residence, Karnofsky Performance 
Score below 70%, hypertension comorbidity, tumor size (>5cm) and well 
differentiated tumors (grade 1) were significant factors for delayed 
presentation. Longer primary delay times and post-menopausal status were 
associated with secondary delay. Advanced cancer stage at diagnosis and those on 
medical aid were more likely to have a delay in treatment onset.
CONCLUSION: Primary and secondary delay were predictive of advanced disease 
using logistic regression.
