OBJECTIVE: To investigate the predictors of postoperative erectile dysfunction 
(ED) in patients who underwent bilateral nerve-sparing laparoscopic radical 
prostatectomy (BNLRP).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with preoperative ED were excluded. 
Postoperative erectile function was assessed using the International Index of 
Erectile Function-5 (IIEF-5) at 6 months postoperatively, with a cutoff score of 
≤12 to define ED. The diagnostic value of associated factors was assessed using 
odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) based on univariate and 
multivariate logistic regression analyses. Only variables with p < 0.05 in 
univariate analysis were included in the multivariate model to avoid 
multicollinearity and overfitting.
RESULTS: A retrospective review was conducted on 79 patients who underwent BNLRP 
for localised prostate cancer between April 2020 and March 2023. Postoperative 
ED was observed in 37 (46.8%) patients. Univariate analysis revealed significant 
associations between ED and age (p < 0.001), diabetes mellitus (p < 0.001), 
coronary artery disease (p < 0.001), hypertension (p < 0.001), Gleason score (p 
< 0.001), operative time (p < 0.001) and intraoperative blood loss (p < 0.001). 
Multivariate logistic regression identified age (OR: 1.136, p = 0.046), diabetes 
mellitus (OR: 32.706, p = 0.003), Gleason score (OR: 4.749, p = 0.015), 
operative time (OR: 1.200, p = 0.001) and blood loss (OR: 1.010, p = 0.039) as 
independent predictors.
CONCLUSIONS: ED after BNLRP is associated with patient-related and surgical 
factors. Identifying these predictors may improve preoperative counselling and 
support early postoperative rehabilitation strategies. Prospective multicentre 
studies are necessary to externally validate these findings.
