BACKGROUND: Depression and suicide ideation are more common among patients with 
chronic physical illness including diabetes mellitus (DM) and hypertension 
(HTN). Depression is often undetected, underdiagnosed, and undertreated during 
routine care and may complicate into suicidal ideation in this population. This 
study aimed to determine the prevalence of depression and suicidal ideation, and 
associated factors among people living with DM and/or HTN in Uganda.
METHODS: We enrolled 512 participants and assessed depression using PHQ-9, and 
suicidal ideation using item 9 of PHQ-9. We run logistic regression models to 
determine the factors associated with depression and suicidal ideation among 
those with DM only, HTN only or both.
RESULTS: The overall prevalence of depression and suicidal ideation was 22.07% 
and 10%, respectively. Among participants with both DM&HTN the prevalence of 
depression was 26.3% while 30.4% had comorbid suicidal ideation. Fear of 
complications (AOR = 7.21; 95% CI =2.68-19.39; p = 0.01) was significantly 
associated with depression. Adherence on antidiabetic medications (AOR = 0.10; 
95% CI = 0.02-0.72; p = 0.02) was protective against depression.
CONCLUSION: The prevalence of depression and suicidal ideation among patients 
with DM and/or HTN in Uganda is high.
