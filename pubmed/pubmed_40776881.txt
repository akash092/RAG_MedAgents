BACKGROUND: Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP), including gestational 
hypertension, preeclampsia, and eclampsia, contribute to increased maternal 
morbidity and mortality and long-term cardiovascular disease risk. It is unclear 
whether HDP arises from pregnancy-specific complications or preexisting maternal 
cardiovascular traits unmasked during pregnancy. This article evaluates whether 
cardiovascular health before pregnancy, assessed by the American Heart 
Association's Life's Essential 8 (LE8) score, is associated with HDP risk.
METHODS: The CARDIA (Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults) is a 
longitudinal cohort study of 5115 Black and White men and women, aged 18 to 30 
years at baseline (1985-1986), and followed for over 30 years (nBlackWomen=1480; 
nWhiteWomen=1307). The LE8 score (range, 0-100) was calculated using health 
behaviors (diet, smoking, physical activity, sleep) and clinical metrics (body 
mass index, blood pressure, cholesterol, glucose). Cardiovascular health was 
categorized as low (LE8 <50), moderate (LE8 50-79), or high (LE8 ≥80). HDP was 
self-reported as gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, or eclampsia in 
pregnancies lasting ≥23 weeks. Generalized mixed models assessed the association 
between LE8 and HDP among 2036 pregnancies from 1227 women, adjusting for age, 
time-varying parity, education, income, follow-up time, cumulative births, and 
multiple gestation.
RESULTS: Mean baseline age was 24.1 years, 48.7% were Black women, and 19.9% 
reported HDP. Women with HDP had lower baseline LE8 scores (77.0 versus 79.5; 
P<0.01). Compared with high cardiovascular health, moderate (odds ratio, 1.78 
[95% CI, 1.13-2.81]) and low cardiovascular health (odds ratio, 3.95 [95% CI, 
1.05-14.88]) were associated with increased HDP risk.
CONCLUSIONS: Lower prepregnancy cardiovascular health is an independent risk 
factor for HDP. Improving cardiovascular health may reduce HDP risk.
