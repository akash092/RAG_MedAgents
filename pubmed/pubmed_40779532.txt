BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease (CKD), especially in its late stages, carries 
significant morbidity and mortality, often due to cardiovascular problems. 
Mortality rates for children with CKD and cardiovascular disorders remain high 
even in high-income countries. Elevated carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) is 
considered a marker for vascular thickness and future cardiovascular events in 
younger populations. This study aimed to determine predictors of cardiovascular 
events in pediatric patients with CKD with CIMT as a surrogate marker.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted on children 
aged 2-18 years with CKD at Dr. Sardjito Hospital, Yogyakarta, Indonesia, from 
September 1st 2022-31st December 2023. We used multivariate logistic regression 
to identify independent predictors at diagnosis (e.g., age, male sex, obesity, 
CKD stage, and hypertension) associated with elevated CIMT (outcome), measured 
at least three months post-diagnosis as a proxy for cardiovascular risk.
RESULTS: A total of 71 patients were recruited, 35 (49.3%) of whom were male, 
and the median age (range) was 14.67 years (4.6-18.8). Twenty-four children 
(33.8%) had increased vascular thickness. In the multivariate analysis, male sex 
was independently associated with increased vascular thickness with an adjusted 
odds ratio (95% CI) of 2.911 (1.012-8.371, p = 0.047).
CONCLUSION: Approximately one in three children with CKD experienced increased 
vascular thickness. Male was an independent predictor for increased vascular 
thickness in children with CKD.
