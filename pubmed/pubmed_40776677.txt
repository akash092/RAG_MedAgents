OBJECTIVES: In a high-risk pregnant population with singleton pregnancies, the 
primary objective was to evaluate the association between anxiety and arterial 
stiffness (AS) and the secondary objective was to investigate whether anxiety is 
associated with the incidence of preeclampsia.
DESIGN: Secondary analysis of a prospective cohort study (2012-2016).
SETTING: Two tertiary care antenatal clinics in Montreal, Canada.
PARTICIPANTS: High-risk pregnant individuals with pre-existing hypertension, 
diabetes, renal dysfunction, previous preeclampsia, or age ≥ 35 years were 
included. Exclusion criteria were excessive alcohol or drug use and 
cardiovascular disease. People with pregnancy loss, incomplete questionnaires 
and loss to follow-up were excluded from analysis.
METHODS: Participants were enrolled before 14-weeks' gestation, with follow-up 
assessments of AS every 4 weeks until delivery. Anxiety symptoms were assessed 
every trimester by the Beck Anxiety Inventory and by self-reported history of 
emotional disorders (anxiety/depression).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: AS and wave reflection parameters, primarily 
carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity and preeclampsia diagnosis.
RESULTS: Of 235 individuals recruited, 161 were included in this secondary 
analysis. Baseline anxiety symptoms were present in 35.4% of participants. 
Anxiety was associated with a significant increase in carotid-femoral pulse wave 
velocity across gestation, which persisted after adjustments for relevant 
confounders, in a combined mixed-effects model (B = 0.27, 95% confidence 
interval [CI] = 0.008-0.530, p = 0.04). A severity-response relationship was 
observed, where greater anxiety severity correlated with higher AS. Twelve 
participants (7.5%) developed preeclampsia. The association between anxiety and 
preeclampsia risk showed a non-significant trend (odds ratio [OR] = 2.77, 95% 
CI = 0.84-9.18). However, a history of emotional disorders significantly 
elevated preeclampsia risk (OR = 3.91, 95% CI = 1.14-13.40), independent of 
other risk factors.
CONCLUSIONS: Anxiety in high-risk pregnancies is associated with increased AS in 
a severity-response manner, and may be associated with preeclampsia risk. 
Integrating psychological health assessments with traditional obstetric 
evaluations could enhance the prediction and management of maternal 
complications.
