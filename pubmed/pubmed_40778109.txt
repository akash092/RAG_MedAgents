Acute kidney injury is a potentially fatal condition, particularly in 
low-resource settings, where access to renal replacement therapy is limited. 
This creates a problem of accessibility to healthcare for many patients living 
in low-resource settings. A 10-year-old boy in rural Ghana presented with 
anuria, edema, hypertension, and seizures, and severely elevated creatinine and 
urea levels were measured. Local peritoneal dialysis was started on Day 4 of 
admission, and the patient showed significant improvement. This report shows the 
effectiveness including subsequent laboratory results of locally made peritoneal 
dialysis and gives a detailed description on how to locally make dialysis fluids 
and how to perform peritoneal dialysis in a low-resource setting.
