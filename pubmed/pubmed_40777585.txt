BACKGROUND: Ankle-brachial index (ABI) is used to diagnose peripheral artery 
disease. Arterial stiffness could be measured by carotid-femoral pulse wave 
velocity (CF-PWV). The study was to investigate relationship between ABI and 
CF-PWV in patients with hypertension and diabetes mellitus.
METHODS: 1577 patients (M/F 812/765) from Department of Vascular Medicine were 
enrolled. ABI was recorded by VaseraVS-1000 vascular screening system (Fukuda 
Denshi, Tokyo, Japan). CF-PWV was recorded by Complior apparatus.
RESULTS: CF-PWV was significantly higher in hypertension patients with diabetes 
mellitus than hypertension patients without diabetes mellitus (13.77 ± 3.91 vs 
11.83 ± 3.26 m/s, p < 0.05). Right ABI was significantly lower in hypertension 
patients with diabetes mellitus than hypertension patients without diabetes 
mellitus (1.062 ± 0.163 vs 1.102 ± 0.105, p < 0.05). Right ABI was negatively 
correlated with age, systolic blood pressure, CF-PWV and creatinine in entire 
study group (r = -0.081, p = 0.001; r = -0.069,p < 0.001; r = -0.178, p < 0.001; 
r = -0.124, p < 0.001, respectively). Multiple linear regressions found that 
CF-PWV, body mass index (BMI), gender, creatinine, total cholesterol, uric acid 
and diabetes mellitus were independent associating factors of RABI in all 
patients (β = -0.168, p < 0.001; β = 0.180, p < 0.001; β = -0.189, p < 0.001; 
β = -0.102, p = 0.008; β = 0.088, p = 0.004; β = -0.100, p = 0.009;β = -0.062, 
p = 0.043; respectively). CF-PWV, BMI, gender and HDL-C were independent 
associating factors of left ABI in all patients (β = -0.170, p < 0.001; 
β = 0.172, p < 0.001; β = -0.104, p = 0.001; β = 0.074, p = 0.023; 
respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: ABI was significantly lower in hypertension patients with diabetes 
mellitus, with higher level of CF-PWV. CF-PWV was an independent associating 
factor of ABI, indicating the greater the elasticity of the large arteries, the 
higher the probability of lower limb artery occlusion.
