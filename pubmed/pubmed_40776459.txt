Treatment adherence is a cornerstone of effective hypertension management. 
However, the dynamic patterns of adherence and their influencing factors among 
young Chinese adults with hypertension remain insufficiently understood. This 
study aimed to explore the trajectories of medication adherence and healthy 
lifestyle behaviors, as well as the associated influencing factors, in this 
population. A mixed methods design was employed. First, a prospective cohort of 
89 young hypertensive patients was established. Adherence was assessed using 
guideline-recommended questionnaires from the 2018 Chinese Hypertension 
Guidelines at the 3rd and 6th months of follow-up. Medication adherence was 
categorized as low, moderate, or high. The healthy lifestyle adherence score 
encompassed six dimensions: diet, salt intake, alcohol consumption, smoking 
status, physical activity, and weight control. Second, semi-structured 
interviews based on the Health Belief Model were conducted to identify factors 
influencing adherence. Qualitative data were coded accordingly. During 
follow-up, 28.07% of participants exhibited a decline in medication adherence, 
whereas 19.30% showed improvement. For healthy lifestyle adherence, 46.07% 
declined and 22.47% improved. Baseline characteristics did not differ 
significantly across different adherence trajectory groups (p > 0.05). A total 
of 27 and 36 individuals participated in interviews regarding medication and 
lifestyle adherence, yielding 553 and 878 codes, respectively. Social, 
environmental, and patient-related factors accounted for 73% and 85% of these 
codes, respectively. The most frequently reported influencing factors included 
reminders and encouragement from family members, childcare responsibilities, 
occupational demands, social obligations, and awareness of hypertension. In 
conclusion, young adults with hypertension commonly experience fluctuations in 
both medication and lifestyle adherence. These variations are predominantly 
influenced by a combination of social, environmental, and individual-level 
factors. Trial Registration: Chinese Clinical Trial Registry
