AIM: Early identification of patients at risk for future cardiovascular events 
is essential. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between 
cardiovascular risk factors and carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) and radial 
intima-media thickness (RIMT).
METHODS: A prospective, descriptive, analytical study design was used. Two 
hundred and fifty patients with one or more modifiable risk factors underwent an 
ultrasound measurement of left and right CIMT and RIMT, according to standard 
guidelines.
RESULTS: Eighty-one percent of patients had two or more risk factors. 
Hypertension was the most common modifiable risk factor (89%), followed by 
obesity (66%). Male gender demonstrated a significant increase in mean CIMT (p < 
0.05). Hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolaemia and smoking 
contributed to a thickened mean CIMT with odds ratios of 3.99, 2.82, 2.47 and 
2.09, respectively (p < 0.05). Combinations associated with a thicker mean CIMT 
included hypertension and diabetes, and hypertension and smoking, with odds 
ratios of 6.92 and 3.67, respectively (p < 0.05). Only hypercholesterolaemia was 
significantly associated with a thicker mean RIMT (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Male gender, increased age, hypertension, diabetes, 
hypercholesterolaemia and smoking significantly contributed to a thickened CIMT, 
whereas only hypercholesterolaemia was associated with a thickened RIMT. 
Hypertension had the most significant impact on the mean CIMT thickness. 
Combinations of risk factors appeared to add summative risks for thickened CIMT 
and RIMT.
